Our Tech-stack :-
============
full stack  = front end + backend 

Any Application has minimum 3 tier architecture :-
1. presentation logic : front end 
2. bussines logic  : application core - logic 
3. database logic  : Queries of database or sql statement.
backend =  server side technology + database technology

Example of full stack technology :
1. Java full stack (Pl: java)
2. .net Full stack (PL: C#(read as seesharp, not seeHash))
3. python full stack (PL: python)
	1. Django,flask,DRF(Django Rest Framework),FastApi.
4. javascript full stack (PL: javascript)

All 3 Tech-stack are of javascript.
MERN/MEAN/MEVN/MESN

frontEnd : React,Angular,Vue Js ,SvelteJs (PL : js)
Backend : Server Side Technology + Database Technology
M : Mongodb : PL:javascript
N : Node Js : PL:javascript

Node js : is a server side run time environment which 
enable javascript to run outside the browser.
in 2008 Google made a engine -> V8 Engine -> Js Server.
Node Js.
vanilla Js : a plain javascript without any framework.

Framework of Node Js :-
1. express
2. meteor 
3. koa
4. fastify 
5. nest 
6. Hapi

React is older in terms.
framework of the React 
1.Next js 
2. Remix
3. UI framework (tailwind,Ant-design)

Framework of Vue Js : Nuxt 

nest 
next 
nuxt 

nest vs next vs nuxt
NodeJs   React  VueJs
Angular 

Entire web works on the basis client and server architecture:-
browser (client)----------> Request-------> Server
server ----> Request ---> accept --> proces -> db connection
----> information ----> response ---> return ---> client 
according to os concepts:-
1. system software or utility software 
2. application software.

Or software Engineering is basically application software 
oriented.

There are 5 types of application software :-
1. CLI or CUI Based app s/w
	Software which on black and white sceen.
	1.cmd 
	2.Linux os, unix os
	3. BIOS (Basic input output system.)
	
	Real time industry :-
	1. Railway General Ticket
	
2. GUI Based App S/w 
	graphical user interface.
	for every action there will some interface involved.
	1. stand alone software or desktop application
		Install
		agree or no -> Next -> Next ->Next -> Yes -> Yes -> finish
	2. Non installable s/w
	Tally GUI based system installed.
	
3. web based app S/w
	1. Not required to be installed
	2. Internet and Browser 
	3. Plateform Independent.
	
4. Mobile Based App S/w
	1. Android (Native) 
	2. IOS (Native)
	3. Hybrid App.(ReactNative,Flutter)
		code base will same and build ios different
		Android different.
		it is called cross plateform development.

5. IOT Application (IOT)
6. cloud based application.
	cloud computing 
	1. IAAS : infrastructure as a service.
	2. PAAS : plateform as a service.
	3. SAAS : software as a service.
	4. BAAS : Backend as a service.(firebase)
